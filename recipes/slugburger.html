    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        If you've seen our Prison Meatloaf video, you know I have no problem adding lots of cheap, 
        starchy filler to a recipe to stretch the meat content, especially when the results are so 
        satisfying and delicious. So, when I discovered the Slugburger after a viewer's request, my 
        first thought was, I really need to make this. Well, actually my first thought was, I'm glad 
        this doesn't have slugs in it. Anyway, the point is I knew I'd love it, and I did. A lot.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>7 slices potato bread</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>6 hamburger buns, split</li>
        <li>¼ cup prepared yellow mustard, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup dill pickle slices, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch chili powder, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees F (80 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment
            paper.</li>
        <li>Cut the crusts off the bread slices. Place slices on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until dry and toasted, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer toasted bread to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until you reach 
            coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Place ground chuck, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder into a bowl. 
            Add bread crumbs. Combine with your fingers, breaking apart the meat.</li>
        <li>Dampen your fingers with water and form mixture into hamburger patties.</li>
        <li>Heat ¼ to ½ inch vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place a patty into 
            the pan and turn heat down to medium. Cook until well browned and crusty, 3 to 4 
            minutes per side. Repeat with remaining patties, adding more oil if needed</li>
        <li>Remove from the pan and serve on hamburger buns with mustard and pickles; sprinkle tops
             of patties with chili powder and/or cayenne if you like prior to serving.  </li>
    </ol>
